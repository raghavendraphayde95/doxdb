DoxDB Sample Web Application
============================

This is a sample web application that uses [DoxDB][].  It shows how
the [DoxDB REST API][] is loaded up.

The sample provides:

* an Angular JS app that uses angular-schema-form to build the UI from 
  the JSON schema.
* an extra REST API that does nothing except prove that it can co-exist
  with `dox-rest`
