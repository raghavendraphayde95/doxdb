Planning
========

This will eventually be moved to some other tool, but for now here are the
initial thoughts.

* Temporal data support - I don't have an immediate need for it yet, but
  the infrastructure should support it eventually as that would be a
  key part in capturing data and performing operations based on facts
  at a given time.
  
* Archiving support - Again my data at the beginning isn't too big as of
  yet but eventually facilities would be needed for archiving the data
